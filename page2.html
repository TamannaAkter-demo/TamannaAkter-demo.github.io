<h1 style="text-align:center"><em> My Hobby </em></h1> <br/>
<p style="text-align:center"><em> My hobby is reading books. I like to read books during my leisure time because when I read books i learn
many new things. We know knowledge is power, and book is the source of that power. Sometimes I also read newspaper and
magazine. Sometimes when I read books I feel stress free. Books are my best friend. If you want to enrich your knowledge
then make the books your best friend and give time to it rather than giving time to your virtual friend.
Then one day your knowledge will be enriched with power. </em></p>
